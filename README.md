## Abstract
Gift of Gab is a speech-generating application used to supplement or replace speech for individuals with severe speech impairments, enabling them to communicate verbally. It's intended for use by individuals who typically use a speech-generating device to communicate,  but would like a smaller, faster, and cheaper option. When a user clicks on a predefined social setting, they are presented with subcategories such as Greetings, transactions, and goodbyes. A user can then choose a subcategory by clicking on it, and they will be presented with a variety of appropriate phrases. When a user clicks on a specific phrase it is played via the mobile device or BlueTooth speaker. Gift of Gab provides the user with an option to choose a voice that they like,  an option to add phrases, and since it is a PWA it allows the user to access their saved phrases even when they are offline.
